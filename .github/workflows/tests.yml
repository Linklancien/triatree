# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: vlang/setup-v@v1.4
        with:
          # Personal access token (PAT) used to fetch the repository. The PAT is configured
          # with the local git config, which enables your scripts to run authenticated git
          # commands. The post-job step removes the PAT.
          #
          # We recommend using a service account with the least permissions necessary.
          # Also when generating a new PAT, select the least scopes necessary.
